## The Campbell-Sauter quartet

We are Elke, Allan, Paco and Lupe, a young family eager to explore the world. Elke and Allan, fell in love with the concept of slow travel after doing the camino de Santiago. After this trip we ran into some sailors that told us about the stories of the sea and we got excited about the possibility of returning to Costa Rica from the Netherlands by boat. We were building the dream, but the money was lacking and Paco decided he wanted to join (Elke got pregnant). We decided to change gears and get gears. We decided to leave the Netherlands by bike and head towards Spain where we would fly back to Costa Rica. We made it :). The prep was short and we had to learn quick. The gear was not ideal but it was good enough, the conditions not the best but still beautiful. Some said we were crazy to take our 1 year old son and dog on bikes during the European winter, but our son loved it, our dog Lupe not so much. An adventure of a life time meant to wrap up our time in Europe and be the stepping stone to our next adventure in the Americas. We are back in Costa Rica day dreaming about our next adventure. 


## Preparation
We will be detailing more in this section. For the moment we want to highlight that confort of this trip depended 300% on the beautiful and informative books prepared by Paul Benjaminse from <a href="https://www.cyclingeurope.nl/">Cycling Europe</a>. The dedication and attention to the user placed in every page of the book made our already complex journey smooth in terms of routing. Whenever we deviated we found trouble. Thanks Paul for all your help in this crazy dream of ours!
