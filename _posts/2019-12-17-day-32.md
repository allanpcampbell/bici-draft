## Last cycle

Origin: Mataró, ES <br>
Destination: Barcelona, ES <br>
Distance: 38km <br>
Time: 4.75hrs <br>

This message was still missing 😬. On Dec 17th, we pedalled our last 38km into Barcelona all along a coastal cyclpath. This day the only challenge was not getting splashed by the sea 🌊💦💙. Without knowing, the ending point in the bike route was the Mirador de Colom, a statue of Christopher Columbus pointing to the Americas. Hero or not, colonizer or not (or yes 🙃), this was where our GPS marked 0.0m making an unintentional introduction to our next destination and stage in life, Costa Rica.

Throughout this last leg we were thinking about our whole journey. We had thought the most sense of accomplishment had been felt on day 1, the exit from Bennekom. The very intense months of preparation, work, move out before the trip gave the NL house exit a special satisfaction. Nonetheless, when arriving to the BCN plaza seing the statue and realizing we had done it.... in our own format (winter bike car baby dog picnic unit) was pretty sweet too 🏁🤩. Barcelona 🚲🖤🚴🏼‍♀🚴‍♂👶🐶!!

Upon arrival, we got reunited with dear Lupe 🐾 by meeting Javi at an amazing Venezuelan restaurant where we celebrated our conclusion with plenty beers 🍻🍺and arepas. We then spent more days with Elke's cousin and wife. They hosted us in their newlywed home and we cooked hiked talked about sharks (they love to dive with them in CR)🦈.
