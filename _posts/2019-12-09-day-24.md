Hi y'all! Long time no speak. Chapter 2 of diary is coming up now. Tmrw we start Chapter 3 in coast of France 🌴. Before sending chunk of posts...wanted to send this which is both too funny and too cute. Thanks for reading along the way! 💓

We drove almost 2 hours from Avignon to our new destination Agde. Everything was going well but of course there is always SOMETHING because A+E tend to always be on the edge. We did not have a place to stay yet. Shit. We had a time crunch since we had to return the car as well. Once we arrived to Agde and had no place, Airbnb responses not coming, the time ticking ⏰. We finally got something...just something so this message deserves few icons. Allan drove back to Montpellier and now is waiting to get the one of the only trains to head back to Agde. Tomorrow the biking continues :) chapter 3💌.
