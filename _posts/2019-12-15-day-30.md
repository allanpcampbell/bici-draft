Dreams play interesting roles in physical outcomes😴💭. Today Elke woke up with a regretful-like dream of having de-routed from Paul's marked route.

Before leaving the cool pool Airbnb we had sent an email to Paul (route creator) asking him about 1) following his mountain route or 2) following Google's ocean national park route. Yesterday when we already were on the road, we got a response by Paul saying that the route from his book was quite more scenic and that there were not many cars on the road. His last line as if marking what was yet to come ahead of us was: 'With only three days left maybe I would not take many risks'. 🧙‍♂

Google friend or foe🙃🙂? The sequel📕. And no not all stories have a Cinderella end 👸. Today was our second to last biking day. Again the goal was to arrive close to Perpignan (in a town called Rivesaltes) where we would rent the van.

Before leaving the hotel we had a discussion on if to correct back to Paul's route🔀. After juggling a couple of scenarios, we choose to keep our current route. We choose to stick to our decision even if it was a wrong decision. Correcting to Paul's route, always left Allan far from the city center making it difficult to rent the van. We prioritized focus on finishing the trip rather than seeing the beautiful fortress-like sceneries. Thing is, as you will read in the following lines, it was not only the sceneries we would skip. De-routing from Paul's route actually meant a loss in safety and comfort.

We left the port with wierd feelings. First 5km were ok through a good highway road passing through the national park but very few cars and nice scenes. Then that road merged into other highway of medium importance. We were left on the shoulder of the road and camper vans and cars gazing past us with hot wheels zzoom 🔥. After 10km of this Elke (who hates cars-gets really nervous and especially with baby sleeping on back) stopped dry and suggested to re-route🙋‍♀. Paco woke up, we had a roadside pic nic and planned the re-route (to be clear this was not to Paul's route, it was an emergency re-route invented by us taking us more through country roads).

Well with this re-route, all that we didn't want to climb we climbed ♐⬆⤴🔝!!! First up on this change, was a strong pedal up a 184m mountain. The climb was through the beautiful town of Fitou. We finally made it to the peak with exhausted legs, specially Allan. The sun came out and the road was gorgeous with beautiful views from the peak. We were up with them birds, clouds and windmills 🦅☁. Safeguarded from the main highway, going past these nice landscapes...we started feeling like we had finally made one right choice. This got Allan like 'la vie es un reve/life is a dream' 🕺. Elke kept emotions at bay, not trusting until the end.

Google friend or foe? Strike 2 ⚾. We were well up that mountain. Up next we had to go to a midway town called Opoul. Both Google and a road sign pointed at a road to Opoul that broke off from the main one. Seemed like a good shortcut, paved road, and we could see in the map it will then rejoin the main road again. What's the worst that could happen? Even if it did, this shortcut was only about 2km long. Pffffff think again. 10min into cycling, pavement ended. Light gravel is ok but baseball-like rocky mountain gravel is another story. We were off our bikes pushing bikes and trailers. Then 10m deep road dips showed up. Physics vrs Elke=literally couldn't push bike up those steep gravelly slopes. Elke was crying 💧all throughout this part. Crying is not accurate, more wailing out 💦. Freaking surprises and sporadic stupid challenges stop showing the hell up!!!! Stop IT❌⛔🚫 and let us finish!! Elke was physically drained and mentally close to break (but at the same time couldn't- we were in the middle of nowhere what are you gonna do). Elke was the navigator and felt responsible for the past decisions and also going off the book...ohhhhh. It's not so much breaking the rules that hit...it was re-inventing the wheel the walk way from the route science + expertise crafting these routes. The 2km shortcut felt like an eternity ♾.

Funny thing is...you know how weeping (as in crying) sounds borderline like laughter? Well Paco who all this time was in the front seat of Allan's bike thought Elke was die hard laughing out 😂🤣😁!! So he was chuckling all the way down 😍😍😍😍. Babies= really 😇.

230m push...100m push...I see the main roadddddd 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳. We connected to the main road. Had 13km to go it was 4pm, 1.5hrs before night hit. Good thing (because when you have hit rock bottom there can always be a a good thing)...good thing was...we had done all our climbing. So all the next part was downhill ⬇. We stopped in Opoul, asked a neighbor for water as we had run out. Put Paco in his trailer to sleep and pedalled down.

We blazed through the night and in no time the pretty lights and bridge that greeted us to Rivesaltes showed up. We arrived to the hotel. Game OVER🕹🖲!
