Days 2-4 were about re-arranging and re-grouping. The bike ride to Nijmegen itself was mostly in the dark since we left Arnhem very late due to a nice celebration with Elke's brother/sister the night before. Night was falling but we still decided to head out. The sunset was pink, beautiful and we went passing over the Waal. At night we went past round green lanterns and through an intergalactic tunnel. Then google oh google pointed at dead end road 📍. We were already tired and it was cold, us wanting to get there so we were pedaling headstrong💨. The strange thing is that despite the legwork we put in it seemed that we did not advance much, we were even surpassed in speed by a running chubby lady. That was our real speed marker. Our trailers were/are quite heavy🐷! Finally we arrived at beautiful hotel Nimma, Nijmegen.

This hotel was our base for three nights. Many bags to reshuffle, Allan's bike pieces to install, Allan sick and Paco sick-ish, much sleep to catch up, next places/hotels to be arranged. After 3 days in Nijmegen the boys got well on their health. Allan got a new grill in the back of the bike and new sidebags to redistribute weight more evenly ⚖. We rested after the crazy Bennekom move out.

Aaaah and why were we so uber slow in the end🐢? Allan was with a deflated trailer wheel which in the eagerness to arrive did not notice.

The next day we hit the road again to a little town called Odiliapeel. Tomorrow cool but sunny day:)
