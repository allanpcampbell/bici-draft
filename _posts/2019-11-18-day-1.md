Origin: Bennekom, NL <br>
Destination: Arnhem, NL <br>
Distance: 19.32km <br>
Time: 1h 45min <br>

We left our house in our beloved village of Bennekom, NL. This day the goal was simply to leave the house.

We managed to leave with the help of Elke's brother/sister. We first went to the neighborhood forest to do a farewell ritual. Then 1/2 crew including Lupe, went by train to Arnhem. Elke, Paco and Allan went by bike. Before embarking we did a last stop at the organic store, grabbed provisions 🍞🧀 and said a few last goodbyes.

That day Bennekom was festive because Sinterklaas arrived 🎅🏻to town, we left with background music from the village parade 🎡🎼.

We left at 4pm, non-efficiently packed, overloaded trailers, pieces of the Allan's bike hanguing out (not yet installed). But we went out 💪🏻. Paco was in his closed trailer and with a hot water bottle. He slept the entire trip-he was warm n' cozy🐨. Emotions flowed and went up and down like the low hills. The afternoon was spectacular. The autumn trees looked like they had gold medallions hanguing down 🍂🍁. The feeling of freedom and achievement was without equal 🦅🖤.

We ended in a spectacular Airbnb to have our last night of with Elke's family in NL 🥂🍻.
