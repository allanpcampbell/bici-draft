## Note

Good morning friends! Sorry for msg backlog. We have been doing quite some logistics and strategizing the past days as one crew member has aborted mission 🐶 (she is fine just not enjoying trailer). Past days too much brain 🧠 time not much writing ✏ and flow time. Below past days posts read when time. Happy weekend to all 💛.


## Day 8
Origin: Ommel, NL <br>
Destination: Kinrooi, BE <br> 
Distance: 47 km <br>
Time: 5.5hrs <br>

Ommel is a horse 🐎town with some of the greatest show and olympic horse riders and horses. Our BnB hosts make horse videos to sell horses all around the world. Very dedicated niche.

Today we left in direction to Maastricht, a city sticking out at the bottom of NL. The creator of the routes had recommended us not to follow the Maas river to get there as the route had an awful lot of useless turns. So we listened and choose a route that passed a bit through Belgium. Our next Airbnb was in BE too. The bike ride was nice. As always we just manage to leave when Paco's nap time is arriving so Paco is a bit grumpy right before we leave but then he falls right asleep. The ride went well and we stopped in a Jumbo supermarket to have lunch and pick up provisions. Today was Allan's b-day so of course we had a little bday party outside of the supermarket 🛒🎈🎂with some amazing sun and good looks from the villagers . Then we rode all the way to Kinrooi BE 🇧🇪. We left NL for a second but not officially. We of course had to come back🇳🇱💙!

Well all in due celebration mode for Allan's b-day after being greated by friendly hotel hosts, we hit the streets to check out what Kinrooi was about. We had to pop 'em beers. Of course the selected dinning offering was a cozy and greasy place called Fritur Nicole 🍟🍟🙅🤣🤣. Cheers to Allan with a good fried fish. Elke was happy to have reached the Belgium side as they also had a homemade (by Nicole :) goulash which was spectacular. Next day we woke up to the B&B t Beek Vallei and made good friends with the owners. They treated us like there sons and gave us egg sandwiches for the road 🥚🍞.
