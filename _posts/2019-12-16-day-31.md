To be on the same page the plan ahead was:

Sun 15: arrive close to Perpignan.
Mon 16: rent a van, cross the Pyrenees, stop van at Mataró (we are now realtime here)
Tues 16: last cycling day of the whole trip. Cycle 33km from Mataró to Barcelona where a non-car + cycling friendly path starts.
Allan returned safely home after returning to France to return the van.

Last cycling day is tmrw OH WOW. For those who love dates today one exact month ago Nov 16, we left Bennekom 🤍.

As rain was supposed to come tmrw at 1pm we are planning to have an early dawn cycle and be in BCN our last destination of the trip tmrw by 1pm. Not sure if we will wake up 🙊.

Too tired to write more 🤗.
