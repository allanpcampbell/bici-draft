About the bike ride, it was COOLD❄🥶. Luckily we have an amazing sheepskin suit for Paco 🐥🐑, a dear gift from my FarmHack family 💙-it was put to good use. Paco rode the front seat in bullet proof manner. That is all regarding the ride. For these days what's worthy to point out my friends..... is that we CAME BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED😱. Yes oh yes. Of course things never follow plans. We couldn't deregister from the Gemeente/Municipality online. So out of the sporadic blue we had to return to Ede-Wageningen by train to deal with some administrative stuff 📄📓🖊. [IN REALITY WE DON'T WANNA LEAVE☺]. Also, as we continue to be super heavy in the trailers we decided to remove: 2 sleeping bags (shipped them back to our good friend Jan) and 4 old phones/e-waste (mailed them to Fairphone ⭕ oh yes still being circular). All in all a good 'errandy' stop before heading down more south.
