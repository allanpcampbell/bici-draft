It was the day to go back to NL. Our last stop in NL : (. The most southern tip of NL. They say that here the dutch have more of a latin vibe. I guess it could be felt?

Today, eventhough it was recommended against by the routes mastermind Paul Benjaminse, today we cycled along the Maas 💧. From the looks of Google it was a pretty straight ride no ferried all looked good and from the sounds of it even romantic pedalling along the river. NOT so much. The bike ride even though beautiful right next to the Maas, was quite challenging and tricky. Let's say we became very much in contact with the dutch landscape. The trail along the river was too narrow for the trailers so we had to detour a lot and as the river is borderlined with dikes then it was hopping on and off⬆⬇ the 10m steep dikes with the heavy trailers. The trail kept switching between gravel and asphalt. Paco did not sleep his nap as expected. AND Lupe was making it very clear that she does not like the trailer. It was a long tiering day 😑. We arrived in Maastricht at night completly exhausted and overwhelmed and happy to be there. As a cherry on top🍒 Lupe did a nice pee🚽 inside the hostel in a rug (super atypical behavior-we think she is quite stressed), so we had to scrub the rug 🧽. What a day!

We had 2 nights in Maastricht at pretty Green Elephant Hostel. Nice new sustainable concept. During these two days we started strategizing (part 1) what to do with Lupe🐶 since she was definitely not happy with the travelling. We decided to send her to Barcelona since we did not think we could continue with her. Luckily we found a place for her with Javi through our good friend el Nico Berges. Now the question became how do we take here. We haven't figured out this yet.

Elke was an early bird 5🦆to get the hostel washing machine before everyone else. In the afternoon we saw a bit of the old city. We went to the river sidelines and we opened Allan's gift 🎁which was planned to be delivered here with Bol.com. Finally we went to have soup and beer 🥄🍺 at a gezelig /cozy/ hygge pub. Elke had a sip of the most greatest of great beer La Duchess du Borgogne.
