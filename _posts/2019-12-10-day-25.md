Write this message now as we have arrived (2hrs ago) to Beziers! Wooppp 🥳🥳🥳! For first time, we are not busy surviving or managing challenges🤘. When natural elements are not all against you = ride and day was arrowhead + easy + simple💘. No story or adventure attached. Phewwwwww needed at least one of those😅. Thought my lines would end there.

BUUUUUTTTTTTTT

Really really funny...😂 The place we booked in Booking.com is a brand new residential 2019 top quality amenities in nice area of the city. HowEVERRRRRR to our surprise it's part of a fancy elders home🧙🏻‍♀🧙‍♂. The top floor is full of hotel-like rooms not used so they rent them out in booking. So entrance to lobby was quite funny 😆. Us all with bikes+helmets+ mud+trailers+baby and group of cool elders having chill afternoon drinks looking at us the parade arriving👫👶🚲🚲📦📦. Of course paco was hit of the afternoon for the seniors.

We arrived early so heading out to town Xmas carnival 🎡🎢🌭🍿🍩✨.
