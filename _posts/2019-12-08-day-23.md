Time: not valid🚐 <br>

The ride was short today so we did some sight seeing 🕶 from the van 💁. We even had a small picnic on the Rhone river banks in the wine town of Tournon. It was a beautiful day (best we've had in a long time☀👌🏻) and we were specially happy because thia day we were going to meet our good friend Yann ❣from Wageningen and he was going to host us at his place 🤩. We arrived at 6pm and were mesmerized by the walled city 🕌, beautifully illuminated. We drove around town while Paco woke up from his nap and then headed to Yann's. It was so nice to see his place. He prepared us an amazing stew and we had some nice talks and nice wine 🍷💭and we had dinner with his roommate and he gave us a quick tour of the city. It is magical. We had a really nice night and happy to be with friends 👭👫👬.
