Our time in NL has officially ended 🔚🇳🇱. We left (no comment). The bike ride was amazing and torturous>read on. Who said that the Netherlands does not have hills ⛰🏔??? This southern part indeed has some and our legs were the ones that took the beating but our eyes and hearts were happy. It was beautiful. We even got a homemade rhubarb-strawberry jam at a top of a hill 🍓. Lupe continued to prove that she does not like, in fact HATES the trailer. It is like having a opera singing dog drilling your ears with her cries making the bike ride a bit unbearable and boiling points were high and boiling.💨😤. It was hard enough to pedal up the steep hills. We choose to let her run a lot but as she is short and thick she doesn't have much resistance. So again an iterative hop on hop off the bikes constantly to out her in/out.

Again the night creeped up on us. Paco quite upset we had to do an emergency diaper change on the side of the dark road. We were well illuminated with all our bike lights 💡💡so people were stopping to see what was going on. Too stressful. After a last climb we got to Aachen city we were relieved and happy. We made it another leg and we are now sure that Lupe doesn't want to ride anymore. Let's say where as Allan Elke Paco are now feeling in flow with our schedules and our things Lupe is not in flow. Sorry Lu.

We spent 2 days in Aachen to continue strategizing (part 2). How to take Lupe to BCN? No high speed trains take her. Not all blah blah cars accept her and not many available in Aachen. See next post what we figured out.

We did however make a thinking break to the Xmas market 💚❤🕯 with beautiful church on background.
