Origin: Dijon, France <br>
Destination: Beaune, France <br>
Distance: 56km <br>
Time: 6hrs <br>

After 5 days base camp in Dijon we are ready to hit the road. Again. We missed 'em bikes 🚲. We were without Lupe so half our weight 🐷🐾was gone. It was a beautiful cycle along the Canal du Midi. For the first time were soaring/sailing/flying ⛵🦅🌬 with great sun ☀. We did a pic-nic alongside a sluice in remberance of the dutch🧀. In this part of the ride we did share the road with some cars 🚙🚕🚗. Especially when night 🌑starts creeping in (we have not mastered leaving early enough) this hightens stress levels. Luckily it was for short pieces. We arrived to fairytale Beaune and felt welcomed like majesty 👑with a rug of Christmas lights lining the main road like a roof. SUCH a magical entrance. ✨ Beaune top hit! 🏆
