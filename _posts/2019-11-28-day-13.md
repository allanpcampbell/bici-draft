Origin: Aachen, GE <br>
Destination: Dijon, FR <br>
Distance: not valid🚙🚐 <br>
Time: not valid 🚗🚚 <br>

We were for 1 day motorized slackers cheaters 🙈 . We were struggling to find solutions to take Lupe and we just figured to rent an oversized moving van. As we have been quite slow...to make it before Xmas to BCN we needed to move a big stretch half of France. So we decided to make Dijon our stop. We love road trips and Lupe was particularly happy about it.

Logistics continue 📉📊: Day 13-We all move to Dijon. Day 14-Allan takes car back to Aachen. Day 15-blah blah car with Lupe. Day 16-Allan train back to Dijon.

We sure do hope logistical stuff ends so we can get into real cycling flow. Currently in Dijon for next 2 days. Happy weekend everyone!
